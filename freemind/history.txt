Changes made in Freemind 0.8.0-ALPHA-DAN-5:
===============================
    * HTML selections are pasted directly as rich text, whether they
      were made in a web browser, Microsoft Word document, or any
      other application that puts HTML to the clipboard. Whether the
      picture elements should be pasted or filtered away is driven by
      the user property cut_out_pictures_when_pasting_html (=true or
      =false),

    * HTML nodes are edited using WYSIWYG editor,

    * HTML nodes with <body> tag get limited width, like plain text
      nodes. To have HTML nodes with unlimited width, use the tag
      <body width=""> or the like of <body width="900">,

    * after a single HTML node is copied to the clipboard, it is
      pasted by applications understanding HTML directly, as rich
      text. An example of such an application is Microsoft Word,

    * copying of HTML nodes and pasting them as plain text does not
      paste HTML tags

    * when exporting to HTML, title of the web page does not show HTML
      tags

    * there is a new function Use Rich Formatting that turns plain
      text node into HTML node

    * action Use Plain Text added

    * after Use Rich Formatting action, new long nodes are rich
      formatted. After Use Plain Text action, new long nodes are plain
      text

    * scrollbars can be switched off using the property no_scrollbar =
      true; can be only set manually in user.properties,

    * user icons can be added. PNG files of the icons have to be added
      to the folder .../.freemind/icons; the comma separated list of
      icon names without the .png extension has to be set in the user
      property user_icons,

    * style to be used in HTML nodes can be determined by setting the
      user property html_long_node_head, like html_long_node_head =
      <style><!-- td { border-style: solid } th { border-style: solid
      } table { border-style: solid } --></style>,

    * in the long node editor, SHIFT+ENTER enters a new line,
      regardless of the "Enter Confirms" setting. Also, ALT+ENTER
      confirms regardless of the "Enter Confirms" setting,

    * when exporting to HTML using the exporting function as of
      FreeMind 0.7.1, the list bullets in exported HTML nodes are
      shown. HTML link contained in HTML nodes are styled normally and
      underlined.

    * find function now works as a keyword search. An example of
      search is - word "two other"; node matches if it (a) contains
      substring "word", and (b) it contains substring "two other".

Changes made in Freemind 0.8.0:

* Corrected shading of the rood node for drag&drop
* Bug fix: Selection mechanism: if drag&drop is started, the node under the cursor is selected. Branches are now selected using AltGr or Alt (depends on OS).
* Mac change: the browser call is changed according to Nick. Thanks.
* Bug fix: If more than one selection, folding and editing with mouse disabled. The old behaviour was not useful as the last selected was opened in the editor or was folded even if one pressed on another node.
* Little feature: folding of many selected nodes is working.
* Bug fix: Continuous selection with Shift key corrected. Now, more than one of these selection ranges can be used.
* Logger is now available at the FreeMind interface.
* Automatic save introduced (necessary feature until undo is available)

RC2:
----
* Bug fix: the context menu for graphical links appears not only in the neighbourhood of the link line, but appears in the *FILLED* arc, that is surrounded by the arc. Fixed.
* Selection method added: selection via mouse click as in office programs.
* Click method:
  - inner node
    + single click: fold
    + double click: fold
  - leaf (node without childs)
    + single click: edit
    + double click: edit
* POSITION is only saved if the node is son of root. This prevents having lots of POSITION tags in the saved XML.
* POSITION is chosen right if dropped onto root. (left half, pasted to left, right half, pasted to - you guess it? - right!)
* Left and Right is respected with ENTER.
* Bug fix: cutting nodes including any of their children or grant-children works now. This removes the bug with a moved tree that is completely marked.

RC1:
----
* Bug fix: nodes with arc and bubble nodes have antialiased text when the antialiasing  of edges is on
* Removed the arc, that distinguished bubble nodes from folded nodes. More discussion is needed.
* Selection method changed: double click is now only for editing if the node is *not* an inner node.
* Documentation enhanced: Creation of graphical links is better described
* Bug fix: Zoom in/out uses step one again.
* Bug fix: System default look and feel is set if so stated in the freemind.properties or user.properties.
