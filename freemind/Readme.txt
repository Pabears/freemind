This is version 0.0.2 of Freemind, the free portable mindmapping program.

STATUS
First of all, this is ALPHA Software! That means, it is not stable. Although I tried to find as many bugs as I could, I'm sure there have survived some. IMPORTANT: The file format will change in future. A future version will bring a more "final" file format, so DON'T SAVE ANY IMPORTANT DATA with this program.

LICENSE
This program is licensed under GPL. Most of its users won't be the normal GNU/Linux users, so I will explain that: I want this program to be of biggest possible use for mankind, so take it as a personal gift from me. Copy it as many times as you want, give it to all your friends, use it whenever you want! (I just hope that you will be as generous in future, too :-) . You may even get the sourcecode, change the program as you wish, and redistribute it. (It would be nice to tell me before redistributing). Take the exact terms from the attached license.

INSTALLATION
This program is written in Java, so you will need the Java Runtime Environment for your OS. It is available for: Linux, Windows, Macintosh, Solaris. Download it at: http://java.sun.com/j2se . You need at least Java 2 Version 1.2 . Install the JRE, and copy a link to freemind.bat (on windows) or freemind.sh (on unix) to your desktop. You can also type "java -jar freemind.jar" on the shell.

FEEDBACK
If you like the program, have some ideas for new features, find any bugs, email me at: joergmueller@bigfoot.com

HOME
The Homepage of this program is http://freemind.sourceforge.net . If you use KDE2, you may also want to look on http://mymap.sourceforge.net .

RESTRICTIONS
This is an early version, so there are many features missing: There is no undo/redo functionality (so be careful what you do ;-), there is no autosaving. All this will be fixed in future releases.

BUGS
The fontselection is buggy, but thats a bug of Java (the swing library), so the only thing I can do is wait...

TODO
I want to implement a modular design, so that various 'modes' on the model-level can easyli be written. Possible modes are: A filesystem browser, a XML/HTML editor, a client to a mindmapping-server (so that multiple users can edit the same mindmap), and everything you can imagine that deals with tree-structures. Relative Hyperlinking and the fileformat are more direct features, and in future I want to create an applet so you can view mindmaps in your browser (combined with hyperlinking, this can lead us to a totally different web). If you can think of anything else one could do with freemind, tell me.
