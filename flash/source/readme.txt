Just a personal freemind flash browser.
It does only load jpg's images (limitation of flash),
 it will improve with time.

USE:
 - insert in any browser page like in the example.
 - user the variable "initLoadFile" to indicate the file to load.
   example:

 <param name="FlashVars" value="initLoadFile=index.mm"/>
