Just a personal freemind flash browser.
It does only load jpg's images (limitation of flash),
 it will improve with time.
 
 For the easy of development flashout (http://www.potapenko.com/flashout/) have
 been used with Eclipse.

USE:
 - insert in any browser page like in the example.
 - use the variable "initLoadFile" to indicate the file to load.
   example:

 <param name="FlashVars" value="initLoadFile=index.mm"/>
 and 
 <embed FlashVars="initLoadFile=index.mm"
